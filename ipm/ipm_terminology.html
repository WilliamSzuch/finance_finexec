<p>
A time weighted rate of return (twr) is a method of calculating the return over a period which 
reduces the impact of external cash flows. Any comparison between portfolios should be done on a 
time weighted return basis. 
For time weighted return for a total period to be measured is broken into many 
sub-periods, which can cover any length of time and need not be uniform. The time weighted rates
of return for the sub-periods are them linked to calculate to the time weighted rate of return
for the total period.

<p>
Also referred to as the internal rate of return (irr) or the dollar weighted rate of return. 
This is used to measure the performance of a fund taking into account external cash flows.
This method is useful when looking at the return of a portfolio in isolation, however there are 
limitations in using money weighted rates of return for any comparisons against other portfloiios, 
or against any benchmark. 
The money weighted rate of return factors in all cash flows, including contributions and 
withdrawals. The methodology will therefore tend to place a greater weight on the performance in periods 
when the portfolio size is highest (hence the term “money weighted”). 
</p>

<a name="Cash_flow"><b>Cash flow</b></a><br>
<p>
The transfer of value into or out of a portfolio. By convention, an inflow is 
considered as positive, and an outflow as negative flow. 
</p>

<a name="External_cash_flow"><b>External cash flow</b></a><br>
<p>
When considering a total portfolio, an external cash flow is a flow of cash and/or 
securities (capital additions or withdrawals) that is investor initiated. Examples of 
external cash flow are contributions and withdrawals. Expense payments are also 
considered as external cash flow.
<br><br>
Cash inflow are positive (eg: 100 10)<br>
Cash outflow are negative (eg: -10 -12)<br>
Cash inflow and outflow (eg: 100 10 -10 -12)
</p>

<a name="Portfolio_value"><b>Portfolio value</b></a><br>
<p>
The total market value of the assets in the portfolio including any accrued income.
