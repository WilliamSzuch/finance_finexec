<a name="Time_unit"><b>Time unit</b></a>
<p>
The time unit is any period or interval of time that has been 
selected for the purposes of the financial calculation to be carried out. 
The selection of a suitable time unit is important as it can impact
on the way a calculation is carried out. 
Common time units are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half yearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quarterly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monthly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daily<br>
Time units are generally of a constant period for a calculation.
</p>

<a name="Frequency_of_payment_within_a_time_unit"><b>Frequency of payment within a time unit</b></a>
<p>
Payment frequencies within a time unit are also commonly
used to describe how the interest rate is to be applied for the calculation.
For example the interest rate might be described as yearly with payments
made monthly. 
</p>

<a name="Period"><b>Period</b></a>
<p>
A period is measured as a number of time units. For example 
a period can be one time unit or a multiple of time units such
as 12, 10.4 or 0.55.
</p>

<a name="Interest_rate"><b>Interest rate</b></a>
<p>
A number of terms are used to describe an interest rate and
how the rate is to be  used in a calculation. 
Often terms in the specification of the 
interest rate are implicit or assumed from general usage eg: 6% pa.
An interest rate requires a number of terms for its 
specification so that it can be interpreted and used 
for financial calculation in a non ambigious way. 
The four main terms used for the specification of an interest rate are: 
</p>

<b>(1) Amount of interest</b>
<p>
The amount of interest can be described 
as 6.0% or 0.06 to be used in calculation.
To aviod confusuion the amount of interest in the Finexec Project
is expressed as a number. For example 0.06 would be used for 6.0%.
</p>

<b>(2) Time unit</b>
<p>
The time unit is the period that the amount of interest 
relates for describing the interest rate.
For example if the amount of interest is 0.06 and we
have time units of a year or half year then the of interest rate 
can be described as 0.06 yearly or 0.06 half yearly.
</p>

<b>(3) Type of interest rate</b>
<p>
We consider four types of interest rates:
<br>
(a) Simple interest rate (Flat interest)<br>
(b) Effective interest rate (Compound interest)<br>
(c) Nominal interest rate (Compound interest)<br>
(d) Force of Interest (Continuous compounding)<br>
These are discussed in further detail below.
</p>

<b>(4) Time</b>
<p>
This is the time from a starting point
of time = 0  from which the interest rate 
applies and is usually expressed in time units.
For example the interest rate that applies from a time 2 years 
from a starting point.
</p>

<a name="Simple_interest_rate"><b>Simple interest rate (Flat interest rate)</b></a>
<p>
The simple interest rate is also often called the flat interest rate.
Under simple interest the amount of accumulated interest is not 
compounded at the end of the time unit applying to
the simple interest rate. At a 10% yearly simple interest 
rate $100 accumulates to $110 after 1 year and $120 after two years.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100 * (1 + 0.1*2)
120
</pre>
<p>
At a 1% monthly simple interest rate $100 accumulates
to $136 after 36 months or 3 years. 
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100 * (1 + 0.01*36)
136
</pre>

<a name="Effective_interest_rate"><b>Effective interest rate (Compound interest rate)</b></a>
<p>
This is the most common type of interest rate used
in financial calculations and is also referred to as the
compound interest rate. The time unit is the 
compunding period for the accumulation of interest
irrespecive of any frequency with which interest is paid
during the time unit. 
<br><br>
$100 invested at a 12% yearly effective interest rate
accumulates to $112 at end of the year, irrespective of the 
frequency with which interest is paid during the year.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100 * (1 + 0.12)
112
</pre>
<p>
At the same rate $100 accumulates to $105.83 half way through
the year.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100 * (1 + 0.12)^0.5
105.83
</pre>
<p>
$100 invested at a 6% half yearly effective interest rate 
accumulates to $126.25 at the end of year 2, 
irrespective of the frequency with which interest is 
paid during the period.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100 * (1 + 0.06)^4 
126.248
</pre>

<a name="Nominal_interest_rate"><b>Nominal interest rate (Compound interest)</b></a>
<p>
A nominal interest rate is described in terms of a nominal
period. 
A nominal interest rate then requires an additional item for its
description. A payment frequency within the nominal period
is required to describe at what intervals or time units 
interest is compounded.
<br><br>
For example if N is a nominal interest rate for a nominal period 
and Z and F is the payment frequency within the the nominal period 
then E = N % F is the effective interest rate for a  
time unit of Z/F.
<br><br>
For example a 0.12 (ie: 12%) yearly nominal interest rate payable monthly is
is equivalent to a 0.01 (ie: 1%) monthly effective interest rate.  In this 
case the nominal period is a year and the payment freqeuncy within
the nominal period is monthly (12).
<br><br>
A 0.12 (ie: 12%) yearly nominal interest rate payable at periods of 1.5 years
is equivalent to a 0.18 (ie: 18%) effective interest rate for 
the new time unit of 1.5 years.
Then $100 invested for 1.5 years would accumulate to $118.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100 * 1.18^1
118   
</pre>
<p>
After 1 year the $100 would accumulate to 111.666
</p>
<pre Class="WE">
   100* 1.18^((1%1.5) % 1)
111.666   
</pre>
<p>
A 0.12 (ie: 12%) yearly nominal interest rate payable at periods of 0.4 years is
is equivalent to a 0.048 (ie: 4.8%) effective interest rate for a new 
time unit of 0.4 years.
<br><br>
$100 invested would accumulate to $112.435 after 1 year.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
  100 * (1.048)^(2.5 % 1) 
112.435  
</pre>

<a name="Force_of_interest"><b>Force of interest (Continuous compounding)</b></a>
<p>
Under a force of interest, interest is compounded 
continuously over the time unit. The force of interest 
is usually assumed to be constant over the time unit 
but can be allowed to vary adding to the comlexity of 
the calculations.
<br><br>
For example at a 10% yearly force of interest, assuming
it is constant over the year, $100 invested for 1 year 
accumulates to $110.52 at the end of the year.
</p>
<pre class="WE">
      100*^0.1
110.517
</pre>
<p>
Assuming a constant force of interest for 5 years $100 
accumulates to $164.87
</p>
<pre class="WE">
   100*^(0.1*5)
164.872
</pre>
<p>
The relationship between an effective interest rate i and
a constant force of interest c (instead of &#948) for a time unit is as follows:<br>
<i>ci(i) =</i> constant force of interest for effective interest rate <i>i</i><br>

<a name="Variable_interest_rates"><b>Variable interest rates</b></a>
<p>
A number of the definitions and calculators allow for the interest rate 
for a time unit to vary over the period of the calculation. For example 
the variable interest rate is entered as a list for the time units with the
last interest rate extended for the period of the calculation.<br>
</p>
<pre>
Examples of variable interest rates:
(1) 0.07
the same rate is applied for the total period
(2) 0.07 0.06 
the rate 0.07 applied to the first time unit and then 0.06 for the 
subsequent time units
(3) 0.07 0.07 0.075 0.06           
the rate 0.06 is applied to the fourth and subsequent time units.

<a name="Effective_discount_rate"><b>Effective discount rate</b></a>
<p>
If we consider one time unit and an effective interest rate <i>i</i> for 
the time unit then and amount of 1 invested at the start of the time 
unit would accumulated to (1+<i>i</i>) at the end of the time unit. With <i>i</i>
being the accumulated interest at the end of the time unit.
It we now consider an investment of (1-<i>d</i>) at the start of the time unit
such that the accumulated amount at the effective interest rate <i>i</i> the end of the
time unit is 1 then:
<pre>
(1-<i>d</i>)(1+<i>i</i>) = 1 and therefore
<i>d</i> = <i>i</i>/(1+<i>i</i>)
<i>d</i> = <i>(1-v)</i> where: <i>v = 1/(1+i)</i>
</pre>
<i>d</i> is referred to as the effective discount rate for the time unit.
<i>d</i> can also be considered as receiving the interest <i>i</i> in advance at 
the start of the time unit.
